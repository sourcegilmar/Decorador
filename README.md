# Decorador
This is a approach for design pattern DECORATOR.
Basically it shows the objects composit and how to implement the Open-Closed principle, 
although in order to add new options, the programmer will have to write a few lines of code,
but the program's main structure will remain intact.
It based upon: Use a cabeça com padrões de projeto, Eric Freeman & Elizabeth Freeman and
Design Patterns book, written by Eric Gamma and others.

This project (written in pure Java language) aims to assist my students learning about design patterns as extra classes activities.
