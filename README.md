# Decorador
This is a approach for design pattern DECORATOR.
Basically it shows the objects composit and how to implement the Open-Closed principle.
It based upon: Use a cabeça com padrões de projeto, Eric Freeman & Elizabeth Freeman and
Design Patterns book, written by Eric Gamma and others.

This project aims to assist my students learning about design patterns as extra classes activities.
